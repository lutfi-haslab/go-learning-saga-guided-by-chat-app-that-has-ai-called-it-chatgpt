Perfect — let’s turn this into something epic, a “Golang Hero’s Journey” — a funny, motivational documentation-style learning plan that feels like an adventure manual for a soon-to-be Go Legend.

Your rank: 🌌 Go Deity
Goal: Bend the runtime to your will. Teach Go itself new tricks.

🎯 Skills to Unlock:
	•	Runtime scheduler internals.
