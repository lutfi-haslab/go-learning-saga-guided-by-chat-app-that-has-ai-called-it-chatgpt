## 🥚 Your Rank: Go Hatchling

Congratulations, traveler — you’ve cracked from your shell and are now squinting into the blinding light of **Go**.  
Your goal this month: **understand Go’s syntax, structure, and mindset** — and write code that doesn’t look like C had a bad day.

---

## 🎯 Main Objectives

1. **Install your armor**: Go toolchain, VS Code/GoLand, and the `go` command line.  
2. **Speak the sacred incantation**:  
   ```bash
   go run main.go

	3.	Learn the Five Runes of Go Syntax:
	•	Variables (var, :=)
	•	Loops (for)
	•	Structs (type)
	•	Slices & Maps
	•	Functions & Interfaces
	4.	Write readable, idiomatic Go — or as the sages say:
“Don’t fight the compiler; it’s your friend with very strict boundaries.”

📜 Lesson I — Hello, World!

Goal: Write your first Go program.

package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, Gopher!")
}

Run it:

go run main.go

Congratulations — you’ve created life.
The compiler didn’t yell at you. That’s progress.

⸻

🧩 Lesson II — Variables & Types

Go hates mystery. Everything has a type.

var name string = "Lutfi"
age := 26 // Type inferred

fmt.Printf("%s is %d years old.\n", name, age)

🧠 Tip:

Prefer := inside functions and var for package-level declarations.
You’ll look like a pro.

⸻

🌀 Lesson III — Control Flow

Loops in Go are monogamous. There’s only for.
No while, no do. Just for.

for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
    fmt.Println("Counting:", i)
}

Conditionals are simple, honest, and don’t require parentheses:

if age >= 18 {
    fmt.Println("Adult Gopher")
} else {
    fmt.Println("Youngling")
}

🧱 Lesson IV — Structs and Slices

Go doesn’t do “classes.”
Instead, you forge Structs — humble containers of logic and identity.

type Contact struct {
    Name  string
    Email string
    Phone string
}

func main() {
    contacts := []Contact{
        {"Alice", "alice@go.dev", "123-456"},
        {"Bob", "bob@go.dev", "789-000"},
    }

    for _, c := range contacts {
        fmt.Println("Contact:", c.Name, "->", c.Email)
    }
}

Structs are data. Methods are power. Combine them, and you wield true Go magic.

⸻

🧙 Lesson V — Interfaces (Shape-Shifting for Mortals)

Interfaces define behavior, not form.

type Notifier interface {
    Notify() string
}

type EmailNotifier struct{ Address string }

func (e EmailNotifier) Notify() string {
    return "Sending email to " + e.Address
}

func SendAlert(n Notifier) {
    fmt.Println(n.Notify())
}

In Go, duck typing means:
“If it quacks like a Notify(), it’s a Notifier.”

🧪 Side Quest: “Hello World Multiverse”

Build a CLI that says hello in 10 languages, including Klingon.

Example CLI usage:

$ go run hello.go es
¡Hola, mundo!
$ go run hello.go tlh
nuqneH, qo'!

Requirements
	•	Use a map[string]string for language codes
	•	Add default behavior for unknown codes
	•	Add --list flag to print all available languages

Bonus XP 💎
	•	Use command-line arguments with os.Args
	•	Format output with fmt.Printf
	•	Write a help message like a polite wizard

🐣 Final Boss: Build a “Contact Book” App

Your first Go project.
The true test of your syntax, logic, and courage.

🏗️ Requirements
	•	Add, list, and delete contacts from a local slice
	•	Save and load contacts from a JSON file
	•	Use structs, slices, maps, and functions effectively
	•	Package name: main

Example:

$ go run main.go add "Alice" alice@go.dev 12345
Added contact: Alice
$ go run main.go list
1. Alice — alice@go.dev

Bonus XP 💾
	•	Use flags (flag package) for arguments
	•	Use encoding/json for persistence
	•	Add search functionality

🧠 Deep Knowledge — “Thinking in Go”
	1.	Avoid over-engineering. Go rewards simplicity, not cleverness.
	2.	Errors are values, not exceptions. Handle them, don’t fear them.

if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}


	3.	Formatting is non-negotiable.

go fmt ./...


	4.	Readability > Abstraction. The compiler is fast; your coworkers aren’t.
